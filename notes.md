# If the React project is created using "create react-app" then ".env" file is declared and initialized as:

REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL="test environment"

# And is accessed as:

process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL

# If the React project is created using "create vite@latest", then ".env" is declared and initialized as:

# auth.js

# Code:

export class AuthService {}

    The code snippet shared is the declaration of an AuthService class in TypeScript/JS. The export keyword indicates that this class is available to be imported into other files. It is likely used for authentication-related operations in an application.

# Purpose:

The AuthService typically includes methods for managing user authentication, such as login, logout, registration, token handling, and user session management.

# Code:

export class AuthService {
constructor() {
this.client
.setEndpoint(config.appwriteUrl)
.setProject(config.appwriteProjectId);
this.account = new Account(this.client);
}
}

# Purpose of the constructor

The constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created.
It is used for setting up the initial state of an object, such as initializing variables or setting up configurations.

# Purpose of the this keyword

The "this" keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to access properties and methods within the class.
In this code:
this.client refers to the client property of the AuthService instance.
this.account refers to the account property of the AuthService instance

# Code

createAccount({email, password, name})

In the createAccount method, object destructuring is used in the parameter list to directly extract the properties email, password, and name from an object passed as an argument.

async createAccount(accountDetails) {
const email = accountDetails.email;
const password = accountDetails.password;
const name = accountDetails.name;

    const userAccount = await this.account.create(ID.unique(), email, password, name);

}

async createAccount({ email, password, name }) {
const userAccount = await this.account.create(ID.unique(), email, password, name);
}

Both are same

# deleteSessions()

    Deletes all the sessions logged in by the user from any browsers

# deleteSession('current')

    Deletes the current session

# createSlice()

The createSlice function from @reduxjs/toolkit simplifies creating Redux slices, combining the reducer logic and actions into a single structure. It automatically generates action creators and handles immutable updates efficiently.

# Code:

export default authSlice.reducer

# Why export reducer instead of reducers?

createSlice also generates a single reducer function that handles all actions defined in the reducers object. This is the core function used by Redux to update the state.
When an action is dispatched, this reducer decides how to modify the state based on the logic defined in the reducers.
Exporting the reducer allows you to integrate it into the Redux store.

# Code:

dispatch(login({userData}))

Dispatching it as an object looks like this as an action:
{
type: "auth/login", // Action type generated by createSlice
payload: { userData: ... } // The userData wrapped inside an object
}

While dispatching it like login(userData) has following thing:
{
type: "auth/login",
payload: ... // userData directly, instead of being wrapped in an object
}

So, there might be confusion while accessing it in reducer function

# What is <Provider>?

<Provider> is a component provided by the react-redux library. It makes the Redux store available to the entire React component tree, enabling components to access the state or dispatch actions.

# For generating regular expressions:

https://regexr.com/

# Code:

matchPattern:(value)=> /^\w+([.-]?\w+)_@\w+([.-]?\w+)_(\.\w{2,3})+$/.test(value) || "Email address must be a valid address",

"/.../" is a regular expression and we are testing it with the value that we will provide and if it doesn't match second statement will be printed

# Select.jsx

# Code:

    {options?.map((option)=>(
                    <option key={option} value={option}>

                    </option>

                ))}

options:

This is likely an array (e.g., ['Option1', 'Option2', 'Option3']) that contains the values you want to display in the dropdown menu.
It is being iterated over using the .map() method.
.map((option) => (...)):

This is a method that creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the options array.
In this case, for each option in the options array, a corresponding <option> element is being created.

<option>:

This is an HTML tag used to define an item in a dropdown list.
Each <option> element has:
key={option}: A unique key property, required by React to track each element in a list.
value={option}: Sets the value of the <option> when selected.
{option}: The displayed text for the <option> in the dropdown.Components:

register:  
A function used to register input elements into React Hook Form's state.

handleSubmit:

A function that wraps your form's submit logic.
